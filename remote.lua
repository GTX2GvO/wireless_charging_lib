  -- The entity specified with "interface_name" is used as energy source for the power transmission. It is up to you how it looks and how much power it supports. It is created automatically when the entity specified by "name" is built and removed when it is destroyed. The charging hot spot is always in the middle. The collision box should be chosen so that the visual representation overlaps with the power grid.
  -- IMPORTANT: Make sure the "interface_name" prototype has the flags "not-blueprintable" and "not-deconstructable"! Recommended are also "not-on-map" and "placeable-off-grid".
